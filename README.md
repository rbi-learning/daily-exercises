# 🏋🏻‍♀️ Daily Exercises 🏃🏾‍♀️

You will need to clone this repository, once you learn how 😀.

Each morning by 9 AM EST, an issue with the label `Exercise` will be filed on this repository, and a link to it will be posted in MS Teams. The issue will contain instructions for your morning exercise. Submitting your work for the exercise will generally consist of either:

- commenting on the issue
- filing your own issue on the repository
- opening a pull request on the repository

#### Make sure you submit _something_ at 10 AM EST each morning, even if you can't fully complete the exercise. Submissions here are one component of how we will take attendance for this course.

At 10 AM EST, we will review submissions and discuss alternate solutions.

We will sometimes use this repository for afternoon challenges as well.
